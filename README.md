Mail list join technical test project.

This project was created using HTML5, vanilla Js for the form submission and validation
and vanilla CSS for styling.

To run and test this project, just open the index.html in any browser.

I'd recommend the usage of Visual Studio Code's Live server plugin, or Node.js
package "serve" to run the project.
