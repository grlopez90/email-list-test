Mail list join technical test project.

This project was created using HTML5, vanilla Js for the form submission and validation.

To install the dependencies, please run "npm install". 

To compile the SCSS while watching for changes and generate the source map, please run "npm run dev".

To just compile the SCSS without a source map, please run "npm run prod".

To run and test this project, just open the index.html in any browser.

I'd recommend the usage of Visual Studio Code's Live server plugin, or Node.js
package "serve" to run the project.
